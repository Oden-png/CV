    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in deep East Texas, the <strong>oldest</strong> town in texas to be exact. From an early age computers fascinated me and it wasnt long before that very fascination became a unique obsession. I just had to learn everything I could about computers and how they work. Early into my 20's I lost someone more important and more precious to me than anything and anyone I've ever known, my Father. Shortly after, I enlisted in the Military where I spent 4 years in the US Navy as a Master at Arms. Nowadays I spend my time at my computer honing and gathering the skills needed to become the ultimate computer wiz. It's been quite the journey and I'm hoping to land my first job as a full fledged Developer soon. </p>
